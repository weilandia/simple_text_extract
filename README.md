# ðŸ“„ SimpleTextExtract

SimpleTextExtract attempts extract text from various file types and is recommended as a guard before resorting to something more extreme like Apache Tika. It is built specifically with ActiveStorage in mind and originally built for the purpose of extracting text from attachments in order to index the text in ElasticSearch.

SimpleTextExtract andlhes parsing text from:

- `.pdf`
- `.docx`
- `.doc`
- `.xlsx`
- `.xls`
- `.csv`
- `.txt` ðŸ˜œ

If no text is parsed (for `pdf`), or a file format is not supported (like images), then `""` is returned and you can move on to try an OCR solution. For example, at [Govly](www.govly.com) use SimpleTextExtract before sending files to [AWS Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "simple_text_extract"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install simple_text_extract

## Usage

Text can be parsed from raw file content or files in the filesystem t by calling `SimpleTextExtract.extract`:

```ruby
# filesystem
extract = SimpleTextExtract.extract(filepath: "path_to_file.pdf")

# raw
extract = SimpleTextExtract.extract(filename: "some_file.raw", raw: "raw contents")

# tempfile
extract = SimpleTextExtract.extract(tempfile: temp_file)



# using ActiveStorage >= 6
extract = attachment.open { |tmp| SimpleTextExtract.extract(tempfile: tmp) }

# raw file content or when ActiveStorage < 6
extract = SimpleTextExtract.extract(filename: attachment.blob.filename, raw: attachment.download)
```

### Usage Dependencies

You can choose to use SimpleTextExtract without the following dependencies, but it won't work for specific file types:

`pdf` parsing requires `poppler-utils`
`doc` parsing requires `antiword`

#### Install deps on MacOS
- `brew install poppler`
- `brew install antiword`

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
